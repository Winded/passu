# Passu

Passu is a simplistic password manager with a CLI interface. It stores named password entries with optional description to a file encrypted with a master password.

## Usage

```
passu <password file>
```

A new file will be created if the specified path does not have one. An interactive command prompt will be shown. Use the `help` command to view available actions.

## Security

I believe this program to be secure enough, but keep in mind I'm not a security expert and this is free software, so use at your own risk.
